# MazePuzzle
Generate a simplest maze puzzle and find the solution.
There are 3 classes in this project (using Eclipse):

1. Maze Generator:
I created a simplest number-based Maze Puzzle generator. (1 is the road, 0 is the wall)
It does not draw a full grid, but a random four-direction line from one corner to another by using backtracking algorithm.
Then it will draw many random small paths orginating from the main the path. 

2. Maze Solution
Create the solution for the generated puzzle by using backtracking. 
Fill the route by number 2.

3.Maze Test
Combine two former class and run the program.
